This is a super simple demo for making `search-index` available in the browser

To run this demo- navigate to this directory and execute the following command:

`npm install`

You can then see the demo by opening `index.html`

Note that in this case, the documents are indexed in the browser after
the page is openened. Keep an eye on the console to see when indexing
completes.
